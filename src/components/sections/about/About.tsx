                    My name is Kristian and my interest is web development. I have been working on web projects for about 5 years in total by now and have picked up some experience along the way.
                    Throughout this time I have been introduced to multiple web development technologies like: C# (.NET Framework, .NET Core, MVC), JavaScript (jQuery, Ajax, React, Vuejs, Angular), testing tools (NUnit, xUnit, Cypress), versioning tools (SVNTortoise, Git) and so on.
                    Neverending thrill for learning new technologies drives me to be a better developer for myself and anyone I work with in the future.
